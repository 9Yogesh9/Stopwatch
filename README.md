# Stopwatch
Stopwatch | Vanilla JS (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap)

Simple Stopwatch implemented with bootstrap, js, html and css

Three buttons :
1. Start - will start stopwatch timer
2. Stop - will hold the current timer ( Pause )
3. Reset - will clear the timer and you can start from fresh

The Date() object provided by js is used to get the current time. Every time you create a specific event and then calculating the difference we are separating the different time elements (hour, minute, second, milisecond).
